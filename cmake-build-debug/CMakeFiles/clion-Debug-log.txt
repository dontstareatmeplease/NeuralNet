CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:8 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findmongocxx.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "mongocxx",
  but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "mongocxx" with any
  of the following names:

    mongocxxConfig.cmake
    mongocxx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "mongocxx" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "mongocxx_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "mongocxx" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
  been installed.
